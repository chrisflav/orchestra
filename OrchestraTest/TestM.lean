# Test monad and `@[test]` attribute

This module provides:
- `TestM`: a monad for writing tests, combining a reader for `AppConfig` access
  and a state monad for accumulating results.
- `Test`: an abbreviation for `TestM Unit`.
- `TestM.assert` / `TestM.fail`: basic assertion primitives.
- `@[test]`: an attribute that registers a declaration of type `Test` so that
  the test driver can discover and run it automatically.
- `Orchestra.runTests`: runs all registered tests and prints a summary.

    `Dirs.dataBaseOverride`. -/

/-! ## Real-taxis-instance opt-in for taxis-backed tests

`Project.*`/`Claim.*` are backed by a real taxis HTTP API (see the "Migrate Project/Issue data
layer" tracking issue), so exercising them for real needs a real taxis instance to talk to — a
fake in-process double would miss real wire-format/validation bugs (see e.g. the `github-pr`
artifact's required `url` field, caught only by testing against the genuine server). Rather than
spawning one automatically (fragile in CI: port allocation, migrations, admin bootstrap, cleanup
on crash), these tests opt in via two environment variables and skip themselves — not fail —
when they're unset, so the rest of the suite stays green without a taxis instance around.

To run them locally: start a taxis instance (`lake exe taxis` in a taxis checkout, or
`docker compose up` in its `docker/` directory — see that repo's README) with an admin actor and
an API token for it (`POST /me/tokens` while authenticated as that actor), then:

```sh
ORCHESTRA_TEST_TAXIS_URL=http://localhost:8080 ORCHESTRA_TEST_TAXIS_TOKEN=<token> lake test
```

The token's actor must be a taxis admin — creating the `t-project`/`o-claimed` labels on first use requires it (see `Project.ensureTaxisConfigured`'s
non-test counterpart, wired into `Main.main` the same way). -/

/-- Configure `Orchestra.Taxis` from `ORCHESTRA_TEST_TAXIS_URL`/`ORCHESTRA_TEST_TAXIS_TOKEN` if
    both are set. Returns whether it did — taxis-backed tests should check this and skip
    themselves (see this module's docs) rather than fail when it's `false`. -/
def ensureTestTaxisConfigured : IO Bool := do
  match ← IO.getEnv "ORCHESTRA_TEST_TAXIS_URL", ← IO.getEnv "ORCHESTRA_TEST_TAXIS_TOKEN" with
  | some url, some token =>
    Orchestra.Taxis.setConfig (some { url, token := some token })

/-! ## Global test registry -/

/-- Global registry of `(name, test)` pairs populated at module-init time
    by `@[test]` initializers.  Never mutate this directly; use
    `registerTest` instead. -/
initialize testRegistryRef : IO.Ref (Array (String × Test)) ←
  IO.mkRef #[]

/-- Register a test by name.  Called automatically by the `@[test]` attribute;
    you normally do not need to call this directly. -/
