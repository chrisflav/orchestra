    Per-process rather than a global `gh auth login`: the queue daemon runs several tasks
    concurrently, each holding its own installation token, and a token written to

    it is process-global and concurrent tasks cannot see each other's credentials. Falls back
    to `gh auth git-credential` — what `gh auth setup-git` would have installed globally — so

    Deliberately scoped to `https://github.com` rather than the bare `credential.helper`. The
    helper hands `$GH_TOKEN` to whoever invokes it, and the slot it is installed in is mounted
    read-write into the agent's sandbox — so under the bare key a `git push
    https://elsewhere.example/x`, whether a typo or a URL an agent was talked into, would ship
    the installation token to that host. Git matches this key against the remote's URL and

Returns the path to the local repository.
When `interactive` is false (e.g. queue mode), user prompts are suppressed and
an error is thrown instead.
Cloning is performed via `gh repo clone`; `token`, when given, authenticates it and every
subsequent network operation through this invocation's environment only. Passing `none`
falls back to whatever ambient `gh` credentials exist, which is only appropriate for
single-task CLI commands.

    in the middle of.

    Two runs outside the queue do still share it, and this is where the analogy with the cache
    clone stops: `ensureCloned` leaves an existing checkout in place, while this deletes one. A
    second `orchestra run` or `orchestra interactive` with no repository, started while the first

/-- Ensure the workspace named `name` exists and is empty, and return its path.

    The counterpart of `ensureSlot` for a repository-independent task: same pooling, same
    occupant bookkeeping, same continuation rule — only with nothing to check out. The agent
    gets an empty directory it can write in, and reaches whatever it needs (other repositories,
    the issue tracker) through the tools it was granted.

    Reset means *emptied*, not cleaned selectively. A clone slot keeps gitignored build output
    between tasks because git can say which files those are; a workspace has nothing that could
    draw that line, so one task's scratch files would otherwise turn up in the next task's

    resumed agent's session describes files it wrote, and without it every continuation would wake
    up to an emptied directory. It is checked against the recorded occupant like the pooled path's

    than resumed onto somebody else's.
